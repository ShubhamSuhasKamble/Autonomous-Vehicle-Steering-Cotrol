# Autonomous-Vehicle-Steering-Cotrol
An end-to-end deep learning project for autonomous vehicle steering using a CNN to predict steering angles from real-time camera images. Trained on simulated driving data, the model enables smooth lane navigation in a virtual environment. Built with Python and Keras, it demonstrates AI-powered control for self-driving cars.
